        <h1>Challenge 1</h1>
        <h2>My Pets</h2>
    
            <p>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</h5>
                
         <h4><b>Lula</b></h4>
            
             <i>Dog</i>
            
             <p>Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with.  I like to take her to the park.  Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.</p>
                
         <h4>Slowpoke</h4>
            
            <i>Turtle</i>
            
            <p>Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.</p>
            
         <h4>Hamster</h4> 
            
            <i>Fish</i>
            
            <p>Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
        <h1>Challenge 2</h1>
        <h2> My Hobbies </h2>

            <h3> Soccer </h3>
            <h4> 5 years </h4>
            <p>Soccer is an awesome sport because you get to
            play on a team with all your friends. I love
            challenge of learning new skills like headers
            and corner kicks.</p>
        
            <h3>Baking</h3>
            <h4> 10 years </h4>
            <p>I love baking because you put together all 
            these things that look simple and boring on 
            their own to make something magical and 
            delicious. I also love how baked things make 
            people happy. Sharing things I bake might be 
            the best part of it! </p>
        
            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <h4>2 years</h4> 
            <p>On the weekend sometimes I got outside and try
            to draw what I see. My favorite thing to draw
            are buildings. </p>

        <h3>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h3>
            <p>Dear Eileene's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
            <p>Starting dates</p>
            <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

First semester: 9 September 2016
Second semester: 15 January 2017
Third semester: 2 May 2017

PleWe are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start datesase let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.

You can find more information about important university dates on our website.

Subjects of study

At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:

Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 300C (860F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)
HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.

So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

Exotic dance moves

Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:

Polynesian chicken dance
A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
Icelandic brownian shuffle
Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
Arctic robot dance
An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.

For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.

Yours sincerely,
Dr Eleanor Gaye
